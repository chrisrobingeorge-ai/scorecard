## Conditional Logic Syntax

The `depends_on` column controls question visibility using these patterns:

| Pattern | Meaning | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `QID` | Show if parent = "Yes" | `ACSI02` |
| `QID=Value` | Show if parent equals Value | `ACSI02=No` |
| `QID!=Value` | Show if parent not equals Value | `ATI03!=Yes` |
| `QID in [A,B,C]` | Show if parent is any of A, B, or C | `Q1 in [Option1,Option2]` |
| `QID not in [A,B]` | Show if parent not in A or B | `Q1 not in [Yes,Maybe]` |
| `Q1; Q2=Yes` | Multiple conditions (AND logic) | Both must be true |

**Note:** All value comparisons are case-insensitive.
