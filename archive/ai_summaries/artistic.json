    "overall_summary": "This month, Alberta Ballet has made notable strides in our artistic journey, particularly in the realm of elevating the art of dance (ART1) and amplifying spectacle and production value (ART2). The productions 'Nijinsky' and 'Once Upon a Time' have showcased a blend of contemporary and classical elements, reflecting our commitment to captivating modern audiences while maintaining cultural relevance. The innovative approaches taken in both productions, such as the use of modern lighting and video projections, indicate a developing momentum towards our goal of enhancing production quality. However, the absence of festival performances and auditions this month is a natural seasonal variation rather than a setback, allowing us to focus on refining our current repertoire and preparing for future opportunities.\n\nIn terms of bold contemporary storytelling (ART3), while 'Nijinsky' addressed social issues like gender equality, 'Once Upon a Time' remained a classic fairy tale, which may limit its contemporary resonance. This highlights an area to watch as we strive to create productions that resonate deeply with modern audiences. The engagement of external collaborators in both productions (ART4) has enriched our artistic offerings, although the lack of festival appearances this month is a reminder of the cyclical nature of our work. Lastly, while recruitment efforts (ART5) are currently inactive, we are in the foundational stages of building a world-class ballet company, with auditions scheduled for the spring, which will be crucial for our long-term growth and success.",

        "summary": "This month, we have seen steady development in elevating the art of dance, particularly through the production 'Once Upon a Time,' which has been classified as a family classic. As it was a remount from a previous creation, the artistic success of this creation predated its origins with Alberta Ballet--though not Francesco, who was the original choreographer for the production. Where Alberta Ballet scores significant points, however, is in the company's ability not only to perform the production in our first tour to Dubai, but that we've been able to adopt it into our own repertoire.\n\n'Once Upon a Time's' innovative elements, such as the original score and modern design, reflect our commitment to fusing classical mastery with contemporary energy. However, the lack of involvement from Alberta-based artists in this production suggests an area to watch as we aim to strengthen local connections in future works."
