Employees want to see *Believe, Reflect, Serve* embedded in leadership behaviour, policy, and everyday interactions.      |\n| **Trust and Safety**             | There is significant fear of retaliation when reporting misconduct. HR is perceived as ineffective; third-party options are needed.                                                        |\n| **Communication & Transparency** | Communication gaps are the single strongest cross-cutting issue. Staff feel uninformed and undervalued due to opaque or sudden decisions.                                                  |\n| **Equity & Representation**      | Unequal treatment (especially of dancers and between cities) undermines the organization\u2019s stated inclusivity. Representation and outreach are seen as moral and reputational imperatives. |\n| **Morale & Stability**           | Low morale, job insecurity, and the removal of flexibility have eroded trust. Restoring consistent, fair practices is viewed as essential.                                                 |\n| **Alignment & Culture**          | The organization\u2019s divisions (Company, School, Community) need shared language, goals, and culture; otherwise, the values framework remains fragmented.                                    |\n"
